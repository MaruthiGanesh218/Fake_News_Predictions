# NEWS CHUNK 2 — Frontend Base UI Layout
# Author: GPT-5 Codecs (acting as a 30–40 year experienced software engineer)
# Behavior: Full write access. Create files, run checks, save results.

## Purpose

Deliver a modular, Tailwind-enabled React layout that surfaces the primary news submission and analysis regions for future integration.

## Files Added / Updated

- `frontend/package.json` — rename project, add scripts, and bundle Tailwind tooling.
- `frontend/src/App.jsx` — orchestrates layout with modular cards and mock loading state.
- `frontend/src/components/*` — header, input, and result cards to keep UI composable.
- `frontend/src/styles/*` — Tailwind entry point plus future-ready utility layer.
- `frontend/tailwind.config.cjs` & `postcss.config.cjs` — Tailwind build plumbing.
- `frontend/CHUNK-02/` — documentation, verification script, and result log for this chunk.

## To-do Checklist

- [x] Ensure `frontend/` exists and is in project root.
- [x] Create `package.json` and Vite React config.
- [x] Implement `src/App.jsx`, `Header.jsx`, `InputCard.jsx`, `ResultCard.jsx`.
- [x] Add `src/styles/index.css` (Tailwind or fallback).
- [x] Add `frontend/.env.example` with `VITE_API_BASE_URL`.
- [x] Add `CHUNK-02/README.md`, `CHUNK-02/RESULT.json`, and `CHUNK-02/verify-chunk-02.sh`.
- [x] Run verification script and write `CHUNK-02/RESULT.json` with real results.
- [x] Ensure all created files include the persona header comment.
- [x] Do not commit any real API keys; only `.env.example` placeholders.

## Local Development

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev server runs on `http://localhost:5173`. Tailwind is configured via PostCSS, so new utility classes are available immediately.

## Verification

```bash
bash ../scripts/verify-chunk-02.sh
# or
bash CHUNK-02/verify-chunk-02.sh
```

The script validates file presence, package scripts, dependency installation, and build health before updating `CHUNK-02/RESULT.json`.

## Tailwind Notes

Tailwind CSS is configured with minimal defaults. If installation fails in constrained environments, replace `src/styles/index.css` with the fallback stylesheet and document the change in this README. For this run the automated install completed successfully.
